    "corhrk.dds ".."Some units can only be obtained by morph, like the Core Dominator (T2 Flak Artillery, morphed from Mortys) and the Arm Zeus (T3 Thermo Kbot, morphed from Mavericks).",
    "corshark.dds ".."Certain units are built in groups of two or more. Their description will show, ie. [x2] so you can know about it, and the cost shown is the total for all units. You retain individual control after they're built.",
    "armsolar.dds ".."You may order your builder or outpost to build structures in an array-like pattern by holding SHIFT+ALT and dragging with the left mouse button. Spread them up by hitting 'T' on keyboard while the Shift key is held. Ctrl+Shift+T brings them closer.",
    "armwin.dds ".."Wind Generators built on high ground have a bonus compared to units built closer to the sea level. Isn't nature beautiful?",
    "armfdrag.dds ".."Dragon Teeth can block low-height missiles, bullets and laser shots, like those from basic kbots. Shark Teeth only block ships movement.",
    "cordrag.dds ".."Arm and Core's Dragon Teeth (DTs) are great to surround perimeters, preventing lower-tech units movement. They also block incoming direct-fire and missiles from going through, so improve your defenses resistance by surrounding them with DTs.",
    "armdrag.dds ".."Artillery is great to break frontline stalemates, but they'll inevitably attract a 'payback wave' after they start firing. Before you start, try and wall-in your towers there and create a 'choke wall' with dragon teeth to turn the odds in your favor.",
    "armcom.dds ".."The D-Gun is the Commander's manual-fire ability and the most powerful weapon in the game, one-shotting even huge experimental T4 units. Upgrade it in the commander menu after your Tech Center is on level 1, then use it with the 'D' keyboard shortcut. Tier 2+ Commanders get the D-Gun by default.",
    "corcom.dds ".."The Commander explosion radius is large, but the heavy EMP aftershock radius is much larger and very long lasting. It's a valid strategy to sacrifice you commander and have an army waiting to take out the remaining enemy units.",
    "armyork.dds ".."Flak-weaponry units, like the Phalanx, fire scattered projectiles. Flak is excellent at taking out fighters and heavy infantry, but will barely scratch tanks and aren't very effective vs heavy air, light or support bots.",
    "armaak.dds ".."The Arm Archangel (Tier 2) and the Core Manticore (T3) fire long range missiles. Like all AA (anti-air) missiles, it's great vs bombers but not so much against fighters.",
	"outpost.dds ".."To build unit factories you need an Outpost. Outposts can morph up to Tier4, with increasingly better build range and LOS.",
    "armsilo.dds ".."It's not just about upgrading the Tech Center! Keep upgrading your outpost. Building structures from it is much cheaper than morphing, and it'll build exclusive structures like Annihilators, Nukes and EMP Launchers.",
    "armshltx.dds ".."To build experimental units like the Krogoth and Bantha, you need an Experimental Gantry, built exclusively by a Level 4 outpost",
    "corafus.dds ".."The 'AFUS' or Advanced Fusion Reactor has the best energy output in your army. You can get AFUSes by morphing a regular Fusion Plant, once you're Tech Level 4",
    "armawin.dds ".."When the wind is blowing in your favor, Advanced Wind Generators are available on Tier 2 as morphs from the regular Wind Generator.",
    "cormuskrat.dds ".."FARKs and Muskrats are units built directly by the Outpost. They're great for early scout, can build dragon eyes (stealth remote cameras) and may assist factories (faster unit production speed).",
    "outpost.dds ".."Outposts can speed up any construction, but they're less cost effective for that than FARKs (built by the outpost) and they spend energy continuously.",
	"armtech.dds ".."To tech up, build a Tech Center, then upgrade it progressively until Tech Tier4. This unlocks high-tier upgrades in factories and outposts as well.",
	"armtech.dds ".."When under attack, Tech Centers can become 70% more resistant if disabled (ON/OFF button or Ctrl+X shortcut)",
    "corraid.dds ".."Vehicles become progressively slower when they drop below 45% health. Use that for your advantage, to prevent them from using hit-and-run tactics effectively.",
	"corgat.dds ".."Gatlings and Flashes are terrific anti-kbot vehicles, very EMP-resistant and moderately effective against lighter gunships. When facing tanks or combos of plasma and missile kbots, don't expect them to last long.",
    "corlevlr.dds ".."Core Lancers and Arm Pokers are early game assault units. One of their unique abilities is the capacity to dodge kbot missiles when properly microed and kept moving at their top speed. Lancers can also transport kbots, including builders",
    "corlevlr.dds ".."The Core Lancer, besides having a weapon with good splash, is able to transport up to two light kbots - including builders. Hint: even allied builders can be transported.",
    "armfav.dds ".."Arm Pokers and Core Lancers are excellent at running over rifle kbots (A.K., Peewee), but are not heavy enough to crush missile or plasma kbots. Keep this in mind if your opponent decides to spam those cheaper units like there's no tomorrow - then make sure he's right. ;)",
	"armrl.dds ".."Missile towers can shoot at both ground and air units, but their anti-air range and damage is much higher than when firing on land units. Nevertheless, they're the best early static response to assault vehicles and tanks.",
    "armsam.dds ".."The Arm Samson has a special ability, the Fire Rain. It's researched per-unit (requires Tier1 Tech) and lobs multiple fire shells, damaging kbots and vehicles in a wide area. Hit 'D' and left-click on target to use it.",
    "corvrad.dds ".."The Core Informer special ability is the Neutron Strike. It's researched per-unit (requires Tier1 Tech) and requires 400 metal to fire, but it's absolutely devastating against vehicles. Not to mention the psychological effect on the enemy.",
    "corvrad.dds ".."Core's Informer, besides its amazing line of sight, can also resurrect units. To unlock it, simply research the Global 'resurrect' upgrade in a Tier 1 Tech Center.",
    "armpw.dds ".."Peewees may acquire a special ability once you get to Tier 1, the laser grenade. It's researched per-unit and lobs a mid-range bouncing projectile, quite effective vs kbots and defenses. To use it, Hit 'D' and left-click on target.",
    "armpnix.dds ".."Advanced Bombers (Tier 2, 3 and 4) cruise flight is higher than the Tier 0 and Tier 1 AA range. You can use this to safely fly over most defenses and scout or hit deep within enemy territory.",
	"armmex.dds ".."Metal Extractors can be morphed into Adv. Metal Extractors at Tier 1, Moho Mexes at Tier 2 and Uber Mexes at Tier 3, with increasingly higher metal output",
	--"Have trouble finding metal spots?\nPress F4 to switch to the metal map.",
	--"Queue-up multiple consecutive unit actions by holding SHIFT.",
	--"Tweak graphic preferences in options (top right corner of the screen).\nWhen your FPS drops, switch to a lower graphic preset.",
    "corgol.dds ".."Tanks can crush lighter enemy kbots, like rifle and missile kbots. Tier 2 tanks can crush dragon teeth, and the Tier 3 Goliath can even crush Tier 2 Tanks.",
    "armmine3.dds ".."Pokers, Arm's basic assault vehicle, can build land mines, great vs kbots, and bar mines, excellent vs vehicles.",
	"armrad.dds ".."Radars are cheap and their detection range is much larger than their vision range. In the early game, Commanders and Outposts are your best options for true vision range.",
    "corape.dds ".."The Rapier is Core's gunship. It holds plenty of missile ammo and excels against most vehicles. Like all gunships, it's specially vulnerable to missile trucks.",
    "armbrawl.dds ".."Arm's gunship is the Brawler. It fires unlimited laser rounds, making it a great anti-kbot unit. Even with its low-altitude, more vulnerable flight mode, the brawler is faster than the Core's Rapier.",
    "armgeo.dds ".."Abandoned/Neutral Geothermals might be scattered around the map and provide plenty of energy. You can capture them with commanders or with builders, after you research the 'capture' upgrade in the Tech Center.",
    "cormort.dds ".."Powerful artillery units are available after you upgrade your Tech Center to Level 1. Core's Morty is built from the kbot lab, Arm Luger from the Vehicle Plant.",
    "armpship.dds ".."Position your naval units properly during engagements. Missile ships are stronger at their rear area, while other ships are stronger at the front. Submarines are up to two times stronger at the front.",
    "corbw.dds ".."Wasps and Banshees are Core and Arm's drones respectively. They're available on Tier 0 air plants and in spite of their mobility, don't have a great line of sight and fly low, meaning they can be hit by any ground unit.",
    "cormist.dds ".."Missile Trucks (Arm Samson & Core Slasher) are very expensive but a) never miss, b) outrange some defenses and c) are the best early-game mobile ground counters to air units.",
    --"cormist.dds ".."Missile Trucks (Arm Samson & Core Slasher) are very expensive but a) never miss, b) outrange some defenses and d) are the best early-game mobile counters to air units.",
    "corrad.dds ".."To know what enemy units are vulnerable to a certain unit you have, point to your unit and hold SHIFT. Colored circles will show up below units on screen. Green means vulnerable to the pointed unit, Red means resistant to it, and so on.",
    "armmark.dds ".."The highest relatively to the ground a unit is, the further it can see (LOS). The T1 Marky is one of the best scouts in the game, besides cloaking it's able to climb steep hills and easily acquire a nice vantage point.",
    "corshad.dds ".."You can 'air freeze' your bombers if they're set to 'Fly' mode. Simply issue a move order and hit 'S' (Stop). They'll turn to that position and hover on the spot.",
	--"To see detailed info about each unit in-game switch on \"Extensive unit info\" via Options menu",
	--"In general, vehicles are a good choice for flat and open battlefields. Kbots are better on hills.",
	--"For wind generators to be worth building, the average wind speed should be over 7. Current, minimum, and maximum wind speeds are shown to the right of the energy bar.",
	--"If your economy is based on wind generators, always build an E storage to have a reserve for when the wind speed drops.",
	--"Commanders have a manual Dgun weapon, which can decimate every unit with one blow.\nPress D to quickly initiate aiming.",

    "armmart.dds ".."Some tanks and long-ranged vehicles can move in reverse if you press 'Ctrl' while issuing a move order behind it. Use this to keep firing while retreating.",
    "corshad.dds ".."Use the air freeze ability (set to 'fly', move then stop) of bombers to group them close and looking at the enemy's direction. This way they'll all hit the target at the same time, maximizing efficiency.",
	--"T2 factories are expensive. Reclaim your T1 lab for metal to fund it",
	--"Air strikes and airdrops may come at any time, always have at least one anti-air unit in your base.",
	--"With ~(tilde)+doubleclick you can place a label with text on the map.\n~(tilde)+middle mouse button for an empty label.\n~(tilde)+mouse drag to draw lines",

	--"Mastering hotkeys is the key to proficiency in TAP.\nUse Z,X,C to quickly cycle between most frequently built structures.",
	--"To share resources with teammates:\n - Double-click tank icon next to the player's name to share units\n - Click-drag metal/energy bar next to player's name to send resources.\n - Press H to share an exact amount.",
	--"It is efficient to support your lab with constructors increasing its build-power.\nRight click on the factory with a constructor selected to guard (assist) with construction",
	--"Remember to separate your highly explosive buildings (like metal makers) from the rest of your base.",
	--"Most long-ranged units are very vulnerable in close combat. Always keep a good distance from your targets.",
	--"Keep all your builders busy.\nPress CTRL+B to select and center camera on your idle constructor.",
	--"The best way to prevent air strikes is building fighters and putting them on PATROL in front of your base.",
	--"Use radar jammers to hide your units from enemy radar and hinder artillery strikes.",
